# coding-quiz

Description:

The task for this coding exercise is to build a timed JavaScript coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.  This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by customized JavaScript code.  It will hopefully have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

Requirements:

As a coding boot camp student, I would like to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.  When I take the code quiz, I click the start button, which starts a timer and displays a question.  When I answer a question, I am presented with another question.  When I answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.  When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over.  When the game is over, I can save my initials and score.
